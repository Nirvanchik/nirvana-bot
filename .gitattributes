# =============================================================================
#                     CAUTION
# THIS PROJECT HAS FILES WITH CRLF AND FILES WITH LF LINE ENDINGS !
# This happened by accident.
# I started this project in 2010-2011 and put code in free svn repository of
# Google [https://code.google.com/archive/p/nirvana-bot/].
# I had been working in Windows always.
# All code had CRLF endings at that time I guess.
# Later, code.google.com was closed and all code moved to github.com
# After that I installed git and all new code after that time has
# LF line endings (because core.autocrlf is true in git).
#
# Currently I decided to leave it as is because blame is valuable for me.
# If you checkout this project in Linux/Mac use git config core.autocrlf off.
# If you checkout this project in Windows:
#1) use git config core.autocrlf off but make sure that your new files have LF
#   and that your editor works fine with LF.
#2) use git config core.autocrlf true but when you move old files make sure
# that you do not update CRLF to LF when committing (disable core.autocrlf and
# comment out line "*text=auto" in this config).
# Our future plan is to get rid of CRLF. All files should have LF in git.
# CRLF must die.
# ======================================================================

# Set the default behavior, in case people don't have core.autocrlf set.
#* text=auto
# I disable it now. I'm not sure we should enable auto.

# Explicitly declare text files you want to always be normalized and converted
# to native line endings on checkout.
*.ini text
*.java text
*.js text
*.MD text
*.properties text
*.txt text
*.xml text

# Declare files that will always have CRLF line endings on checkout.
# CMD are srcipts for Windows shell only.
# They hava crlf currently so let them always have it.
# I hope no one in Linux will touch them.
*.cmd text eol=crlf

# Denote all files that are truly binary and should not be modified.
*.jar binary
